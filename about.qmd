**Our Founder**

*Founder* \| *Research Scientist* \| *Practitioner \| Ivy League Graduate*

Our founder, Daniel Goldberg, built Grey Shield Research on the foundation of his two greatest strengths: experience in corrections, and expertise in analytics. With nearly a decade of combined academic and professional work in corrections, Daniel understands the challenges of both correctional officers, and the researchers.

-   **Hands on Experience** - Daniel began his career as a Correctional Officer with the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) at the maximum security William P. Clements Jr. unit. During this time, Daniel was primarily assigned to General Population, but has experience working in High Security and Psychiatric departments as well.

-   **Advanced Ivy League Education** - After 18 months working as a correctional officer, Daniel pursued and earned his Masters of Science degree from the University of Pennsylvania. His masters thesis examined the impact of Administrative Segregation Housing Policy Changes on Misconduct in the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.

-   **Academic and Professional Expertise** - After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania, Daniel worked as a Research Assistant and Adjunct Professor at the University of Central Florida. During this time, he was also the Assistant to the Editor at Corrections: Policy, Practice and Research (CPPR), an academic journal. Today, Daniel works as a Research Scientist II at the University of New Mexico's Institute for Social Research. Daniel collaborates with various agencies across the state of New Mexico, producing reports and publications that inform managers, practitioners, scientists, and the general public on correctional practices throughout the state.

*Beyond the Research*

On his off time, he enjoys his hobbies such as running, playing Dungeons and Dragons, Otaku Culture, collecting autographed books, and caring for his two beloved rabbits, Phoenix and Cowboy.
