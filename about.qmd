**Our Founder**

*Founder* \| *Research Scientist* \| *Practitioner* \| *Ivy League Graduate*

Our founder, Daniel Goldberg, built Grey Shield Research on the foundation of his two greatest strengths: experience in corrections and expertise in analytics. With nearly a decade of combined academic and professional work in corrections, Daniel understands the challenges faced by correctional officers, agencies, and researchers alike.

- **Hands-On Experience** — Daniel began his career as a Correctional Officer with the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) at the maximum-security William P. Clements Jr. Unit. During this time, he was primarily assigned to General Population but also gained experience working in High Security and Psychiatric departments.

- **Advanced Ivy League Education** — After 18 months as a correctional officer, Daniel pursued and earned his Master of Science degree from the University of Pennsylvania. His master’s thesis examined the impact of administrative segregation housing policy changes on misconduct in the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.

- **Academic and Professional Expertise** — After graduating from Penn, Daniel worked as a Research Assistant and Adjunct Professor at the University of Central Florida. He also served as Assistant to the Editor at *Corrections: Policy, Practice and Research* (CPPR), an academic journal. Today, Daniel is a Research Scientist II at the University of New Mexico’s Institute for Social Research, collaborating with agencies across New Mexico to produce reports and publications that inform managers, practitioners, scientists, and the public on correctional practices statewide.

**Beyond the Research**

In his free time, Daniel enjoys running, playing *Dungeons & Dragons*, engaging with otaku culture, collecting autographed books, and caring for his two beloved rabbits, Phoenix and Cowboy.
