With nearly a decade of combined academic and professional work in corrections, Daniel understands the challenges faced by correctional officers, agencies, and researchers alike.\n\nHands-On Experience — Daniel began his career as a Correctional Officer with the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) at the maximum-security William P. Clements Jr. Unit. During this time, he was primarily assigned to General Population but also gained experience working in High Security and Psychiatric departments.\nAdvanced Ivy League Education — After 18 months as a correctional officer, Daniel pursued and earned his Master of Science degree from the University of Pennsylvania. His master’s thesis examined the impact of administrative segregation housing policy changes on misconduct in the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.\nAcademic and Professional Expertise — After graduating from Penn, Daniel worked as a Research Assistant and Adjunct Professor at the University of Central Florida. He also served as Assistant to the Editor at Corrections: Policy, Practice and Research (CPPR), an academic journal. Today, Daniel is a Research Scientist II at the University of New Mexico’s Institute for Social Research, collaborating with agencies across New Mexico to produce reports and publications that inform managers, practitioners, scientists, and the public on correctional practices statewide.\n\n\nBeyond the Research\nIn his free time, Daniel enjoys running, playing Dungeons & Dragons, engaging with otaku culture, collecting autographed books, and caring for his two beloved rabbits, Phoenix and Cowboy."

    "text": "What Kind of Services does Grey Shield Research Offer\nWe are a data and analytics company that offers data cleaning and solutions, statistical analyses, program evaluations, and any other kinds of reporting and analysis. We specialize in these services within the correctional space. Whether you need a simple project like a descriptive statistics for your jail, complicated experiment or quasi-experiment, or a program evaluation, we want to help you!\nWe Have a New Pilot Program for Inmates/Officers/Judges, etc. Can You Help Us Analyze it?\nAbsolutely! We are data nerds who are always excited to work on new and novel programs! Whether you are in the beginning stages and would like help designing the program in a way that will make it easy to evaluate, or your program has concluded and you need your data cleaned and analyzed, we are here for you!\nWe Are Replicating or Repeating a Program, and We Want To Determine the Impact/Scalability of this Program, Can You Help?\nAbsolutely! Finding out why a program works, and if it can be scaled/replicated is one of the corner stones of criminal justice. Whether it is a step down program for high risk gang members, or helping judges determine who is a low risk for pre-trial release, we can help!\nCan You Testify in Court or a City/County Meeting?\nIn person or virtually! We are happy to come to you (although this may cost a little more) or testify virtually. Whether we are speaking to a small group Correctional Officers or a large state or federal legislative body, we are happy to come discuss our research, findings, implications, and methods!\nWe are a Rural Law Enforcement Agency, Can You Help?\nAbsolutely! We love small agencies! In fact, we are proudly located in a small town (Belen, NM; Population: 7,474), which is located in a small county (Valencia County; Population: 79.149). We take great pride in our small town roots and love helping small towns and counties!\nWe understand the unique data challenges that smaller agencies may face, whether it is the state capital making data requirements tricky, or a program having fewer participants, thus making data harder to track. We want to be the solution to your data needs! We can offer budget friendly solutions that have worked in other rural areas, or help you collect data for your own pilot programs! We have the expertise in statistical analysis, criminology/criminal justice theory, and data science to help your agency reach your goals!\nWe are a Law Enforcement Agency, However, We Are Not Involved in Corrections or Courts, Can You Still Help Us?\nUnfortunately, we are only able to provide assistance in the area of Corrections and Courts. The needs of correctional facilities and pre-trial agencies are fairly unique, as an example, prison gangs pose a different type of security risk than street gangs. Actions that would work in a prison to combat gang violence would differ from actions that a police department may be able to employ to combat gang violence. Due to these large differences between sub-fields, we simply may not be able to assist all agencies, however, we are always happy to give a free consultation to determine if we can assist you in any way!\nIf we cannot assist your agency, we may be able to refer you to another company that specializes in your specific area of interest. We want to guarantee the best outcome for your agency and unfortunately we may not be the best fit for all agencies.\nWe are a Law Enforcement Agency located Outside of America, Can You Help?\nUnfortunately, we may not be able to assist all agencies in all countries. We want to be upfront in our expertise. Our staff is all located and educated in the United States of America. We hold advanced degrees and may be able to assist in some of the data collection and analysis, however, we are only familiar with laws in America regarding corrections, so we may not be able to provide evidence based solutions beyond an analysis when assisting international clients.\nWill You Use My Data For Anything Outside of the Scope of Work?\nYour data is your property and we would never breach confidentiality. We will not use your data for anything outside of the scope of work of the contract unless explicit, written permission was granted by the owners of the data. Your data will be secured in a password protected external data storage device (such as an external hard drive) unless you wish to have the data stored another way.\nWhile we offer some discount for projects that are willing to allow us to use their data (as some clients have us use public data), the default option is always privacy and any exceptions to this must be in writing. We are willing to sign Non-Disclosure Agreements and provide other privacy guarantees."
