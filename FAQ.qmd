**What Kind of Services does Grey Shield Research Offer**

We are a data and analytics company that offers data cleaning and solutions, statistical analyses, program evaluations, and any other kinds of reporting and analysis. We specialize in these services within the correctional space. Whether you need a simple project like a descriptive statistics for your jail, complicated experiment or quasi-experiment, or a program evaluation, we want to help you! 

**We Have a New Pilot Program for Inmates/Officers/Judges, etc. Can You Help Us Analyze it?**

Absolutely! We are data nerds who are always excited to work on new and novel programs! Whether you are in the beginning stages and would like help designing the program in a way that will make it easy to evaluate, or your program has concluded and you need your data cleaned and analyzed, we are here for you! 

**We Are Replicating or Repeating a Program, and We Want To Determine the Impact/Scalability of this Program, Can You Help?**

Absolutely! Finding out why a program works, and if it can be scaled/replicated is one of the corner stones of criminal justice. Whether it is a step down program for high risk gang members, or helping judges determine who is a low risk for pre-trial release, we can help! 

**Can You Testify in Court or a City/County Meeting?**
In person or virtually! We are happy to come to you (although this may cost a little more) or testify virtually. Whether we are speaking to a small group Correctional Officers or a large state or federal legislative body, we are happy to come discuss our research, findings, implications, and methods! 

**We are a Rural Law Enforcement Agency, Can You Help?**
Absolutely! We love small agencies! In fact, we are proudly located in a small town (Belen, NM; Population: 7,474), which is located in a small county (Valencia County; Population: 79.149). We take great pride in our small town roots and love helping small towns and counties! We understand the unique data challenges that smaller agencies may face, whether it is the state capital making data requirements tricky, or a program having fewer participants, thus making data harder to track. We want to be the solution to your data needs! We can offer budget friendly solutions that have worked in other rural areas, or help you collect data for your own pilot programs! We have the expertise in statistical analysis, criminology/criminal justice theory, and data science to help your agency reach your goals! 

**We are a Law Enforcement Agency located Outside of America, Can You Help?** 
Unfortunately, we may not be able to assist all agencies in all countries. We want to be upfront in our expertise. Our staff is all located and educated in the United States of America. We hold advanced degrees and may be able to assist in some of the data collection and analysis, however, we are only familiar with laws in America regarding corrections, so we may not be able to provide evidence based solutions beyond an analysis when assisting international clients.
